# odin-recipes
This is an exercise on the basics of HTML. I will be putting together a simple recipe website using what I have learned from the Odin Project. When I have finished, I will have successfully demonstrated that I know, and am able to use various HTML elements.

After finishing this project, here are my main takeaways for my future projects:

 - I need to pay more attention when writing <img> elements and remember to add the alt attribute
 - I should always consider the size of any images I am embedding beforehand
 - I need to be consistent in my writing style for the text in my pages
 - I also need to be consistent in my style when writing git commit messages. I should use the same words to describe the same actions, such as only using the word "finish" or "complete" to describe a completed task, rather than randomly alternating between both.
 - Finally, I need to write better names for any resources I use. "spaghetti-and-meatballs.jpeg" is better than "spaghettiandmeatballs.jpeg". Long names with no spaces get confusing to look at amongst everything else.
